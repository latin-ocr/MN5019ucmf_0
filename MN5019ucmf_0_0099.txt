afterwards was expelled from them like his brothers, because he would
not join 10 110 religion 01110 English. lt was at this time that King
Edward reigned in England; the Viceroy said that these lands be-
longed 10 110 king, and hence that he would dispose 01 thern as he
pleased, and give them to whomsocwer 10 wished. Accordingly, the
Viceroy, by royal authority, gave them 10 0 certain English captain
named Herynge, who until this time kept them in his possession, though
001 with much peace 3 and 00 this account the said captain, who also
was anxious to return 10 England, sold the said lands to the abore-men-
tioned Thomas Stuckley 101· awery small sum 01 money, because the
landa were nothis own, nor had he leave or power to sell them. The
present Queen, who was very iered with the said Thomas for many rea-
sons, because he had 001 1000 what he had promised, and because he
had committed greatdepredations on many merchants 01 England, who

men 10 Ireland in order to conquer it, promising at the same time that
protectior or saror would nothe wanting 10 them· This he would not
10 because he was a Catholic3 and it 10 plain that no protectiou could
be hoped for from Stuckley who had destroyed so many churches,
monasterias, and images3 and what favor could 10 promise to gire,
who was anatire 01 England, who was so hated hy his own people,
and much more hated hythe lrish, as well 00 0000001 01110 natural
and common hatred the Irish bear against the English, as 00 0000001
01110 particular hatred they bore him, for having purchased and ocen-
