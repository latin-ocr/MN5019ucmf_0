lhese lands which 'ehe herolios divide among ehem, and one of ihe
eondihions lhey impose is, snae lhey mush talne the oaih of 'ohe supre-
maey of vhe King3 and in this way uhey have yeopled the possessionis
of she illustrious prinees and Catholie Earls O'Neill, O’DonnelL
, Desmond, Maooailhy More,O'Ronlie,hlagui1·e,&o. They have also
seined lhe eounues and bavoiaies ollhe De Burgoa O'Sulh'van, O'hloono,
O'Oonnor, O'Keenans, and olhens who look up arins against the henelies,
and joined 'vhe forces ol his Gaiholio hlay'eshy in ene wais whioh lasled
many years, in whioh they infiioled severe losses on ene English.
Though ene hereiios aneso anxious io exiend lheii· seul and (lnaw
people lo ie, yei when they find any priesl weak enough uo oome oven
lo them and leave lhe Ohnisiian religion, ihey negard him with oon-
templ, and look on him as a person of low senlimenls and evil lile, as
was seen in hhe ease of en English priesi who, when offered 'ohe oalh
of supremaey, said he would lake iu, and added dhan he did noh con-
sider anyone a good and loyal suby'eoh who would reluse il, by whieh
he seandaliaed vhe Oalholios, and lesi ihe good opinion of the Vioeioy,
who told the Chanoelloi· ahai the inan would swear anylhing and he
would nol honour him wilh the oalh.
' Lailenly, aller hauassing nne nobles, they have lurned their

hand lo ihe mea-enanis, whom they preveni from irading wilh foreign
oounhies, allowing none bue English eo engage in this business; oi· il
hhey permis any Irishman, ii is only on condition of halving the profils
wilh the Eing.

The objeel of ene English in all hhese injurios is no othei· bui to

deshoy the spinil and energy of ihe Irish, and oompel them to become
fugitives and leave their lands, on, remaining, to make them o1·ouoh in
suhjeolion like slaves, and thus root oni the Catholio saian. To this
end also lhey elosed all the sohools and planes ol slndy, eviling oi·
mundering hhose who iaughi in ehem if eoolesiastios, removed the
magistrales, prohibiled ihe lawyers from pleading‚ and subsuiluled in
ihs plane of all lhese, noh persons beelei· qualified, but elne somnos
sooiely‚ who one and all rob lhe Christiane, and in many inslanees
murder ihem3 so euoenon only she gallows are crowded wilh Chris-
tians, bul even lhe trees are loaded wilh them, hhe lasling pi'ool of
the mad haered and muel lynanny of iheii enemies. All ihis, lhongh
ooounring daily, is more marked ab lhe Quonim· Sessions, when they
thus punish lhose who commines no olhen crime hul lha'a of hanbouving
piiesls in their houses.
