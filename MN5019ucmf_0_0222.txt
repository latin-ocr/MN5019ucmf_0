Vnnv annnnrvn Sra,

With the exception of some slight dissensions among the elergy of
Dublin, there is not much to trouble us in other parts of this kingdom, ¹
although we place but little confidence in this calm. Some, however,
have been sowing the coekle of pestiferous opinions, as your· Reverenee
will see from the documenta which are herewith iorwarded to the
Saored Congregation. We are endeavouring, under the guidance of
the Bishop of Ossory, to root out the evil planta, whilst we await the
instructions of the Sacred Congregation as to the further course which
we should pursue.
¹ Ι endeavoured, in accordance with the instructions conveyed by
your letter of the ath ot* March last year, to forward letters through
the Tuscan Ambassador who resides in Loudon, but this ¹did not
succeed, as Ι have not any permanent correspondent in London who
could eall at the Ambassador's tor the letters sent in reply. Hence Ι
have abandoned that course, and Ι now send the letters through
Francia, availing myself of the hindness of the Nuncio at whose hands
Ihave at all times experienced the greatest courtesy. , . .

The rath November, 1333.

Your most obliged servant,
loun, Bishop oi Ferus.
