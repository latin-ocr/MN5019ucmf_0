Ι have heard that the Bishop of Meath excuses himself from the
task assigned to him by the Saered Congregation regarding the
Englishrnan Paul Harris, whom the Sacred Congregation is anxious to
see removed from the Diooese oi Dublin I am not surprised that the
Bishop of llleath should hesitate to execute that oomnrission, ior he
foresees that it would gire rise to still greater noise and confusion on
account of the favour which Harris enjoys with the Royal Ministers,
the more so as the Viceroy has given orders to the same Harris not to
depart from the oity on any account. For my part, Ithink it would
be better to leave this old crotchety man alone, since he does not
attempt to administer any of the Sacraments, nor does it affecthirn in the
least that the laity never assist at his Mass. He lives in a very poor
and quiet roem, and with the exception of thatrage of animosity wlrioh
he has shown towards the Religious Orders, he was always esteerned
a learned and exemplary man.

Wexford, aoth October, 1635.
Your most· affectionate, dvo,

J 01111, Bishop of Ferus.
