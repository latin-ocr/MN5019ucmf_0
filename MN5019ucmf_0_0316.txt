in'finding out new ways to extirpate cur religion, and to punish and
persecute ye professore thereof there, where upon her most excellent
majesty‚ the right of foreign ambassadors, contrary to the public faith

of contracte and law of naticns, is violated‚ which gives us just cause ,
to suspect what is reserved and prepared for us. ’

In pursuance cf the like proJ'ect upon us, we have been interdicted
from arms and ammantica, being invited by a late proclamation, made
in the beginning of the present troubles, to stand upon our own defence,
and tc provide arms for our own defense 3 nevertheless the same, by
letters subsequent directed to the said Lord Olanricarde‚ was counter-
, manded, as appears by his letters to the mayor and officers of the town
of Galway, and what good meaning was thereby intended every indiffer-
ent man may judge, &a

Since the beginning of these troubles, Dublin, eorl, or Youghall
offended not, yet ye Catholics there were disarmed‚ and their goods
rifled with impunity, which course others may fear, and expect no
more favour than Polyphemus promised to Ulisses, dcc.

Before any declaration made in Galway, the persons, ships, and
gocds cf our gentry and merchants were seined upon and arrested, and
are so still detained upon nc other ground but under colour of a quarrel
to their religion, dcc.

That all the Catholios cf this Kingdom are engaged inthis
common cause of religion, very few excepted, and therefore it would
ill become us, being but a handful cf their members, to expect
the fruit of their pains and labour, and not participate of their hazards,
losses, and dangers.

That the general opinion conceived of the disunion of this Kingdom
would be confirmed bya present separation of this country from the
rest, to the great weahening of sach as already adventured for this
Catholic cause, and to the great discouragement of such as yet ere
members, and great encouragement of such as propound to themselves
the ruin of our religion, persons, and estates, dcc.

That there is no hope that upon the general subversion of religion
this town and county should be preserved as a relic and nursery of that
which Puritans term Popery and superstition, dcc.

It is a proven maxim that qai macrim noo cst cocu-c rae estin
this war. We cannot be admitted 'members if we light against the
Oatlrolio cause; we must expect that judgment given upon that King
of Israel, the reason whereof is given in lroly writ to be “impio praebes
auxilium etcum operantibus iniquitatem amicitia jungeris,” dcc. Ἴ
