Dr. Wauchop enjoyed the friendship 01 St. ignatius, and as early as the month 01
March, 1510, obtained from him two 01 his first companions to iabour on the 1rish
mission. The special instruction which St. ignatius gave these holy men when setting

cut for our island was, to instruct the children assiduously in the catechism. When ⁴

the Genera] Counril 01 Trent was prorogued on the 11111 01 September, 1519, our
Archbishop proceeded to Scotland to seek aid there for the 111011 chieftains. Dr,
Dowdall, at this time schismatieal Archbishop 01 Armagh, wrote to the Lord Chanccllor
011110011101101110101111011221111 March, lara-50, that he was a most clangerous man,
‘¹' 0 very shrewd spy, as Ι henr say, and a great brewer 01 war and sedition.”—(Shirley,
‘⁴ Original 1101101οᾆγ p. 38). The State Papers further inform us that he was success-
1111111 obtaining the promise 01 aid from both Franee and Scotiand, and that 110 cameto
Derry “with two great Lords, Frenchmen, out 01 Sacoena? 10101111 011 0111111100 with
the two northern chieftains, O'Neill and 0110011011-(001, St, Pap. Ireland, vol. 1., p.
lov). These chieftains were ready enough to receive aid in 111011, money, aad ammuni-
tion, but they do not seem 10 have at all relished the scheme proposed by Dr. Waucbop,
that Ireland should 10 made an independent hingdom, with one 01 110 French royal ⁴
family as hing. 111 0 11011001111111011111111110 011111,Η Pro 111101011011111110110110, Legata

in 1551, buthe did not long enjoy that high dignity: whilst awaiting a favorahle
opportunity 101 entering the kingdom, 110 died in Paris on the 10th 01 November, 1551,
