an Englishman named Babington, whose miserable end became soon
alter notorious. The one died suddenly, and the other was lost at
sea, atter they had satisfied their ruge on an lmage 01 Our Lady
renowned for its miracles, which was the pride 01 the Christiane 01
that part 01 the country which it adorned. This image the he'retical
bishops twice cast into the lire with their own hands 101 none 01111011·
servants would venture to do so, and it came out on both occasions as
sale and sound as ever. They then hored holes in it which they filled
with chips and tar, and then our Lord permitted it to burn, repaying
the miscrahle bishops 101 11110 great sacrilege with the deaths mentioned
above. Others write 10 say that an arm 01 this image has been saved,
which the Catholics carried off, while the heretics carefully ecattered
the ashes 01 the image lest anyone might collect thern· This happened
last September, 1611.

The native and Catholicmagtstrates, and other ministers 01 justice,
have been deposed from their offioes, and declared ineligible 101Ι any
other under Gorernment, 101 refusing to take the cath of the supre-
macy 01 the King awerthe Ohuroh, and 0100011001110100011001101111110
sacrilegious meetings 01 the 11010110ος others are in prison, and the
lires 01 many 01 them run a great rish. Cruel edicts have been pub·
11010100010011110(1111101100, and particularly against the alumni 01
the foreign seminaries, their parents, relatives, and friends, as also
against all such as contribule to their education. In 000001110010
your collegas the heretics hare established various schools, though till
lately they had closed the door 01 all such establishments, and have
placed heretical masters in them to corrupt the children 110111 their
tender infanoy.

As to the noblemen and gentlemen, they annoy them in many ways,
inspecting their written tides, and raising difficulties and objections
10 them, no matter how legally they may be drawn up, that they may
by this means and through vile calumnies deprive thern 01 their lands
and 0000000101ιο ς and whoewer does not submit 10 this must take out
new writings made to the teste 01 the heretios and subject to a thou-
sand penalties and nullities. Openly, and without disguise, they seiae
the lands 01 many who can prove the long possession 01111010 by their
ancient Irish 1011111100 ; and if they spare their lives, they thinlr they
show them great mei-cy, though they condemn them to exile, 0011010-
hibit their return under the penalty 01 death.
