they will repent 01 having had recourse to his tribunal, for the Viceroy
ise stern man, ond desirous 01 maintaining peace amongst us, not
through any affection which he bears 0111061160, but because the laity
are always more 01 1600 agitated by our dissensione. For the present
the Viceroy is engaged with State affairs, and can pay no attention to
such trivial matters ; but as soon as the Parliament, which has now met
for the second time, will have closed its Sessions, we will see an ener-
0106 01 authority which will not be pleasing to eweryone.

111 the present Parliament it was unanimously agreed, as well by
the Catholics as by the Protestants, to present a gift to the King
greater than what the King himself expected. They granted six snb-
sidies, to be paid within four yeers, amounting to about sooboo scudi,
a large gift 101 a kingdom 00 poor as our’s.

In return for the devotedness thus shown by his subjeots iu the
first Session 01 Parliament, we are in hopes to obtain in this second
Session several Graces from hisillay‘esty, Graces which haye 011611 been
ashed 101, and also promised, but hitherto without effect. There are
several heads 01 these Graoes which have 101 their object to relieve the
Catholios by moderating the penal enactments, and abolishing 1116 enac-
tious which are made in the Protestant Episcopal 0011110 101 1310110100,
urar-nages, and Burials‚ at which Catholic Priests may have ministered.
Ewen though we should not obtain more then a part of the desired
Graues, the gift will 11011111116116611 made in rain.

The Bishop 01 Ossory, who is the senior Bishop 01 Ireland, is
suffering a little from infirmity. When he shall be taken from us,
our loss will be truly great, 101 he is a worthy Prelate and 0 great
servant 01 God, and he acts as a sentinel keeping ns all iu order,
Bishops, priests, or friars that we may be, telling each one his faults,
and for this reason some censure him as being over neolone, butiri
truth we stand in need 01 such e watchful monitor in these regions
01 linense and liberty.

From Kilkenny, the l5th 01 November, 1634.

Most affectionatc and obliged servant,

Jonu, Bishop 01 Ferus.
