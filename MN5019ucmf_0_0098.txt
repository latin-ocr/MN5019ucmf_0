A short time since, 00011010 Englishman named Thomas Stuchley,
cameto Spain, who, as I have been informed is from the (1011011 01

long time, under 1110 service 01 the Duke 01 80110111, being servant 01
the said Duhe, and wearing 1110111011, as is customary in said country.
After the death 01 the said Duke, having captured a ship (1 know not
by what 100000), and embracing 1110 1110 01 a pirate, he robbed 011 the
vessels that he could, and then carne to Ireland to 0011 what he had
stolen. For this he was taken up by an Irish gentleman, conducted
to England, and 0000110011101110110οᾶοοΤο1101, where 110 was hept
1001000 imprisonment 101 00010 11010 ; but afterwards, through the
