oity and Gastle 01 Dublin. From that time 10 the end 01 January,
1612, the hlinisters 01 the King did their best to indnoe the Bishop
and the priest to abandon the faith, sometimes with praise and pro-
mises, other times with threats, and again with the offer 01 bishoprios
andbenefioes ; but, seeing that nothing 01 all those things moved
these servants 01 God to eooede to their desires, they 1111111111οἂ
charges against them, arousing them 0111011011 to the (lrown 01 Eng-
land, and with assisting the Catholios at war by saying Messes aad
administering the sacramente to them; but they oould find on other
orime in them. Sentenoe 01 death was pronounoed against them, and
the lst 01 February 01 this present year they were brought to the soal-
10111. The Bishop was 111 avehiole drawn by horses, aad 110 said he
went 111011 more comfortably to death than his hlaster, our Lord J esus
Christ, who had to wallr on foot and bear the weight 01 His oross.

Along the med by which they went there was a multitude 01 ,

people 01 all degrees, surh as was never seen at suoh a speotaole
10101ος and the Catholies, despising the danger, oast themselves upon
their lrnees to asli the bishop’s blessing, which he gave them to satisfy
their devotion, and the blows and hiohs 01 the heretios were not suffi-
oient to detor them.

Two heretioal ministers went along with the Bishop preaohing to
him, and persuading him to submit to the meroy 011110 Vioeroy. He
answered them again and again that he was too old, and had note high
enough estimation 01 their religion to allow himself to yield to their
wishes, aad abendon God, 110111 whom he had reoeived so muoh good.
They arrived at the plaee 01 punishment, where the heretios had
everything prepared. They made the Bishop mount the soaffold, and
on every step 01 the ladder he paused to pray, and then he addressed
the multitude, and the ministers 01 justice interfered with him, that
he might not pervert the people. The heretioal ministers told him to
confess that he died 101 treason to the King, and not 101 his religion,
he answered that 110 could 1101 110, and that he died beoause he would not
abendon the Roman carnotenae, and in proof 01 this that they had
offered him his life and property 11 he would become a heretis. At
this the ministers olamoured that he should be desyoatohed at ouoe,
and prevented 11011 talking. Atthis moment a oourier arrived 11011
the Vioeroy, demanding 01 the Bishop to confess 1101010 the people that
he died a traitor and not 101· his religion, bnt he gave him the same
auswers as he had given the ministers.
